NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen.

Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on.
